In the next 100 days, I hope to be able to familiarize myself with the syntax and functions in python and get to know what I can do with python.
I want to able to solve practical problems with python.

I intend to spend 2 and a half hours each day (between 11:00 hours to 15:00 hours) or more and I would hold myself accountable to that.

A fun fact about me is that I love to read about art (paintings, poems, sculptures) even though I do not know how to do any of them.
